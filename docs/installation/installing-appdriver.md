# Installing AppDriver

> Note: Before you can successfully start writing tests with AppDriver, it is required that you have Appium correctly configured. For more information, see the official Appium documentation.

Once Appium is correctly configured, simply install AppDriver via NPM:

```bash
# npm
npm i appdriver --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add -D appdriver
```
