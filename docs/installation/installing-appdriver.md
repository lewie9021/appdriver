# Installing AppDriver

> Note: Before you can successfully start writing tests with AppDriver, it is required that you have Appium correctly configured. For more information, see the [official Appium documentation](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/).

Once Appium is correctly configured, simply install AppDriver via NPM:

```bash
# npm
npm i appdriver --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add -D appdriver
```
